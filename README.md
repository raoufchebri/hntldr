- Fetches full article content for top-performing stories
- Uses OpenAI to generate concise summaries
- Creates audio versions using ElevenLabs text-to-speech
- Stores audio files in S3 for web playback

- PostgreSQL database (Neon.tech recommended)
- [Resend](https://resend.com) account for email newsletters
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com) API key for summaries
- [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) account for voice generation
- AWS Account with:
  - AWS CLI installed and configured
  - IAM permissions for:
    - Lambda function creation and management
    - S3 bucket creation and management
    - EventBridge rule creation

## Database Setup (Neon)

1. Create a Neon account:
   - Go to [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
   - Sign up for a free account

2. Create a new project:
   - Click "New Project"
   - Name it "hntldr" (or your preferred name)
   - Choose your region
   - Click "Create Project"

3. Set up the database schema:
   ```bash
   # Connect to your database
   psql <your_connection_string>
   
   # Run the schema file
   \i schema.sql
   ```
   The schema file creates:
   - `hacker_news_rankings`: Tracks HN story rankings and scores
   - `subscribers`: Manages newsletter subscribers
   - `summary_daily`: Stores daily story summaries
   - `summary_weekly`: Stores weekly story summaries
   - `summary_sources`: Links summaries to their source stories

4. Get your connection strings:
   - Go to your project dashboard
   - Click "Connection Details"
   - Copy the connection strings
   - Update your `.env` file:
     ```
     DATABASE_URL_PROD=your_production_connection_string
     DATABASE_URL_DEV=your_development_connection_string
     ```

5. Enable Connection Pooling (recommended for production):
   - Go to your project settings
   - Enable "Connection Pooling"
   - Use the pooled connection string for better performance
